- Throughput (processes/time unit)
- Context Switch Count and Overhead

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
- C++17 compatible compiler (g++ 7.0+, clang++ 5.0+)
- GNU Make
```

### Building

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Breezy1214/CPU-Scheduler.git
cd CPU-Scheduler

# Build the project
make build

# Run the simulator
./bin/scheduler
```

### Quick Demo

```bash
# Run a quick demonstration
./bin/scheduler --demo

# Compare all algorithms with 10 random processes
./bin/scheduler -n 10 -a all

# Run Round Robin with custom quantum
./bin/scheduler -n 5 -a rr -q 8
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

Launch without arguments for an interactive menu:
```bash
./bin/scheduler
```

### Command-Line Mode

```bash
# Generate processes and run specific algorithm
./bin/scheduler -n <count> -a <algorithm> [options]

# Load processes from file
./bin/scheduler -f processes.txt -a all

# Run benchmark
./bin/scheduler -b -o results.csv
```

### Algorithm Options
- `rr` - Round Robin
- `pp` - Priority Preemptive
- `pnp` - Priority Non-Preemptive
- `mlq` - Multilevel Queue
- `mlfq` - Multilevel Feedback Queue
- `all` - Run all and compare

### Example Process File Format

PID Priority BurstTime ArrivalTime
1 2 10 0
2 1 5 1
3 3 8 2
```

|-----------|--------------|----------------|----------|------------|
| Round Robin | 12.4 | 25.8 | 95% | 0.39 |
| Priority (P) | 10.2 | 23.1 | 96% | 0.41 |
| Priority (NP) | 14.7 | 28.2 | 94% | 0.37 |

*Results with 10 processes, quantum=4, context switch time=1*

## Algorithms Explained

### Round Robin
Fair time-sharing algorithm where each process gets equal CPU time slices. Excellent for interactive systems.

### Priority Scheduling
Processes with higher priority execute first. Aging prevents starvation of low-priority processes.

### Multilevel Queue
Processes are assigned to fixed priority queues based on their type (system, interactive, batch).

### Multilevel Feedback Queue
Processes dynamically move between queues based on behavior. CPU-bound processes move down, I/O-bound stay up.

## Known Issues & Limitations

- No actual I/O simulation (processes don't block)
- Single-core simulation only
- Discrete time units (not real-time microseconds)
- No memory management simulation

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Additional algorithms (SJF, SRTF, CFS)
- [ ] Multi-core CPU simulation
- [ ] I/O operations and blocking
- [ ] GUI interface
- [ ] Real-time process creation
- [ ] Machine learning for burst time prediction
